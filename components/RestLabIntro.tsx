          <p>
            You can send requests in RestLab to connect to APIs you are working
            with. To learn more, see{" "}
            <Link

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Write scripts</h2>
          <p>
            RestLab includes a powerful runtime that enables you to add dynamic
            behavior to requests and collections. You can write scripts that run
            before or after requests to perform API tests, build requests with
            dynamic parameters, pass data between requests, and more. To learn
            more, see{" "}

        <div>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Use collections</h2>
          <p>
            RestLab Collections are groups of saved requests. You can use
            collections to organize and group your requests, and then run them
            together. Collections can be run manually, on a schedule, or as part
            of CI/CD pipelines. To learn more, see{" "}

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Use RestLab Flows</h2>
          <p>
            RestLab Flows is a visual tool for creating API workflows. You can
            chain requests, handle data, and design real-world workflows
            directly in your RestLab workspace. See{" "}

          <p>
            The RestLab CLI is a secure command-line companion for RestLab. You
            can run collections, send run results to RestLab, validate API
            definitions against rules, and more. To learn more, see{" "}

          <p>
            RestLab provides collaboration tools for teams. You can create
            shared workspaces where team members can work together on API
            projects. Users can also comment directly on collections, APIs, and
            requests. See{" "}
